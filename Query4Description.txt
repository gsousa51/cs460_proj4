Query 4 Description
-------------------

Parameter: Receptionist ID
Values: The medications/prescriber/and patients for all records in the receptionist's data.

That is, for every patient in the Receptionist's logs of appointment, if they are prescribed a medicine, we return the pharmacist in charge of it,
the patient's name, and the medicine.


This query satisfies all parts of the spec because we must first reference the Receptionist table, and then move to the Receptionist_Data table to pull
in all patients and their medicine. Then using the PID found in Receptionist_Data, we join on the Pharamcist table on the matching PIDs.

In reality, this query would be useful if we wanted to see what percentages of patients were being prescribed what medications, but breaking it up
into various pieces. In this case, these pieces would be partitioned by the receptionist who holds the patient's appointment.
